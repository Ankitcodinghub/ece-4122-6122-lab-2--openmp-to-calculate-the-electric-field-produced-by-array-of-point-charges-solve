Category: Custom Classes and Multithreading

Objective:

To understand and apply the principles of OpenMP for parallel calculations in a computationallyintensive problem related to the Electric Field calculations.

Description:

‚Ä¢ Redo Lab1 but use OpenMP to create a multithreaded application.

‚Ä¢ You do not have to use the classes from Lab1.

‚Ä¢ Create a short one page report (pdf) describing your results with a graph showing the processing time results of a 1000 x 1000 grid for o 1 thread o 2 threads o 4 threads o 8 threads

o 16 threads

OverView:

Create an application that uses OpenMP for multithreading to calculate the electric field at a point in space.

‚Ä¢ Your program should query the user for how many threads to run concurrently when doing the calculation.

‚Ä¢ Your program needs to query the user for the size of the N x M array and the charge q.

‚Ä¢ Your program should continuously prompt the user if a new calculation is wanted.

‚Ä¢ Your program should use OpenMP to reduce the processing time taken.

‚Ä¢ After calculating the resultant electric field your program should output the Ex, Ey, Ez values and the resultant electric field strength.

‚Ä¢ Your program should also output how long it takes in microseconds from the time the user inputs the xyz location to just before the results are output to the screen.

‚Ä¢ Spaces separate the values when entering multiple inputs.

‚Ä¢ Make sure you check for valid inputs o N and M should be natural numbers.

o Separation distances should be &gt; 0.0 and be valid numerical values o Charge should be a valid numerical value.

o Point location should be made up of valid numerical values.

Sample Program Flow:

ÔÉò Please enter the number of concurrent threads to use: 16

ÔÉò Please enter the number of rows and columns in the N x M array: 100 100

ÔÉò Please enter the x and y separation distances in meters: 0.01 0.03

ÔÉò Please enter the common charge on the points in micro C: 0.02

ÔÉò

ÔÉò Please enter the location in space to determine the electric field (x y z) in meters: 1.0 2.0 3.0 ÔÉò The electric field at (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) in V/m is

ÔÉò Ex = x.xxxx * 10^y

ÔÉò Ey = x.xxxx * 10^y

ÔÉò Ez = x.xxxx * 10^y

ÔÉò |E| = x.xxxx * 10^y

ÔÉò The calculation took x.xxxx microsec!

ÔÉò Do you want to enter a new location (Y/N)? Y

ÔÉò

ÔÉò Please enter the location in space to determine the electric field (x y z) in meters: 2.0 2.0 2.0 ÔÉò The electric field at (2.0, 2.0, 2.0) in V/m is

ÔÉò Ex = x.xxxx * 10^y

ÔÉò Ey = x.xxxx * 10^y

ÔÉò Ez = x.xxxx * 10^y

ÔÉò |E| = x.xxxx * 10^y

ÔÉò The calculation took x.xxxx microsec! ÔÉò Do you want to enter a new location (Y/N)? N ÔÉò Bye!

AUTOMATIC GRADING POINT DEDUCTIONS PER PROBLEM:

Element Percentage Deduction Details

Does Not Compile 40% Code does not compile on PACE-ICE!

Does Not Match Output Up to 90% The code compiles but does not produce correct outputs.

Runtime and efficiency of code setup Up to 20% The code generates the correct output but runs slower than expected.

Clear Self-Documenting Coding Styles Up to 25% This can include incorrect indentation, using unclear variable names, unclear/missing comments, or compiling with warnings. (See Appendix A)

LATE POLICY

Element Percentage Deduction Details

Appendix A: Coding Standards

Indentation:

When using if/for/while statements, make sure you indent 4 spaces for the content inside those. Also make sure that you use spaces to make the code more readable. For example:

for (int i; i &lt; 10; i++)

{ j = j + i;

}

If you have nested statements, you should use multiple indentions. Each { should be on its own line (like the for loop) If you have else or else if statements after your if statement, they should be on their own line.

for (int i; i &lt; 10; i++)

{

if (i &lt; 5) { counter++; k -= i; } else

{ k +=1; } j += i;

}

Camel Case:

This naming convention has the first letter of the variable be lower case, and the first letter in each new word be capitalized (e.g. firstSecondThird).

This applies for functions and member functions as well!

The main exception to this is class names, where the first letter should also be capitalized.

Variable and Function Names:

Your variable and function names should be clear about what that variable or function represents. Do not use one letter variables, but use abbreviations when it is appropriate (for example: ‚Äúimag‚Äù instead of

‚Äúimaginary‚Äù). The more descriptive your variable and function names are, the more readable your code will be. This is the idea behind self-documenting code.

File Headers:

Every file should have the following header at the top

/*

Author: your name

Class: ECE4122 or ECE6122 (section)

Description:

What is the purpose of this file?

*/

Code Comments:

1. Every function must have a comment section describing the purpose of the function, the input and output parameters, the return value (if any).

2. Every class must have a comment section to describe the purpose of the class.

3. Comments need to be placed inside of functions/loops to assist in the understanding of the flow of the code.
